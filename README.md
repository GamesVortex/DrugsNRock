<3, Drugs and RockNRoll - for iPhone
------------------------------------

"<3, Drugs and RockNRoll" is a multiplayer rhythm game for iPhone that was designed in 48 hours during Global Game Jam'13.

Introduction
------------
"<3, Drugs and RockNRoll" is a multiplayer rhythm game in which you have to tap on items coming from the top of the screen. When you have on a line several items, you can choose one of these items. There are different kinds of items : normal and special items. Special items influence your heartbeat (which is also the bpm of the currently playing music). If your heartbeat goes outside the 50-220 boundaries, you will die.
In multiplayer mode, you have a combo bar at the top of the screen. When your combo bar is full (you have not missed any item out of the last ten items) the next special item you  missed will be applied to your opponent.

Enjoy!
